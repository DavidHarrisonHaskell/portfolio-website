        contributing innovative solutions. My experience includes projects like <b>developing a REST API for a mock
        restaurant, creating a MERN-based e-commerce platform, and designing a full-stack factory management

    <p>
        Beyond technical expertise, I am a <b>proactive team player and self-learner</b>, constantly improving my skill
